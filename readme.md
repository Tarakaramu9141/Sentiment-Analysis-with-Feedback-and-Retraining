# Sentiment Analysis with Feedback and Retraining

This project implements a sentiment analysis system that allows for user feedback and model retraining. It uses a Logistic Regression model with TF-IDF vectorization for simplicity and effectiveness.

## How to Run the Project

1.  **Setup Environment**:
    * Ensure the directory structure is as shown above.
    * Place your dataset (`sentiment_data.xlsx`) in the `data/` directory.
    * Create a virtual environment (recommended):
        ```bash
        python -m venv venv
        source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
        venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
        ```
    * Install dependencies:
        ```bash
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```

2.  **Train Initial Model**:
    * Run the following script to train the initial model and generate `trained_model.pkl`:
        ```bash
        python scripts/train_initial_model.py
        ```
    * This script combines the original dataset with any existing feedback data, trains a Logistic Regression model, and saves it.

3.  **Launch API**:
    * Start the Flask server by running:
        ```bash
        python app/api.py
        ```
    * The server will be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

4.  **Provide Feedback**:
    * Open the web application in your browser.
    * Enter a statement to predict its sentiment.
    * After the prediction, you'll be redirected to a feedback page.
    * Provide feedback by indicating whether the prediction was correct and optionally specifying a category.
    * The `training_model` updates incrementally with each feedback submission.

5.  **Retrain (Optional)**:
    * Periodically, run the `retrain_model.py` script to fully retrain the `training_model` with all accumulated feedback:
        ```bash
        python scripts/retrain_model.py
        ```
    * This ensures that the model remains accurate and reflects all user feedback.

6. **This is a basic model and developing the model using better transformers if it's done, I will update the pkl file**
   * If you want the transformers model code dm me*

## Additional Notes

* **Model Choice**:
    * Logistic Regression with TF-IDF is used for its simplicity and effectiveness.
    * For more complex scenarios or larger datasets, consider using deep learning models (e.g., LSTM, Transformers). This would require additional setup and dependencies (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow).
* **Feedback Mechanism**:
    * User feedback is stored in `feedback/feedback_data.csv`.
    * The `training_model` is updated incrementally with each feedback entry.
    * The `retrain_model.py` script provides a mechanism for full model retraining, ensuring stability and incorporating all feedback.
* **HTML Templates**:
    * The `app/templates` directory contains HTML templates for the main page (`index.html`) and the feedback page (`feedback.html`).
* **API Structure**:
    * The `app/api.py` file contains the Flask application logic, including routes for sentiment prediction and feedback processing.

## Enhancements

* **Deep Learning Model**: Implement a deep learning model for improved accuracy.
* **Advanced Feedback**: Add more detailed feedback options (e.g., sentiment score, specific error types).
* **Web UI Improvements**: Enhance the web interface with better styling and user experience.
* **Deployment**: Deploy the application to a cloud platform (e.g., Heroku, AWS).
* **Error Handling**: add robust error handling and logging.
* **Data Validation**: add data validation to input fields.
* **Testing**: add unit tests and integration tests.
